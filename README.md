# Ze-Kaiser-2.0
A Discord bot, mainly for the BYU CS and eSports servers.

This is an expansion of an already existing discord bot that mainly serves as an administrative helper.
The idea behind this project is to add functionality for event scheduling, configurable help commands, and configurable conveniences on a per-server basis.

I will likely use lowdb, a document-based NoSQL database software, for the second implementation of the project.

Business: This bot is open source, free for anyone to use.
Legal: Only other open source/free libraries will be used.
Technical: This project uses Discord.js and npm to run, and again will likely use lowdb. The bot is run and hosted on a raspberry pi that I own.

Note: This was initialized from an existing codebase, so the total number of commits will be skewed, and some commits will exist from other users.
