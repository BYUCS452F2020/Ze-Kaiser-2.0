I really like the idea of working on a discord bot, especially since it is one that I use on a daily basis.  I have lots of experience with programming and creating applications so I feel that I would be a valuable addition to the development of this bot.  The bot get’s a lot of usage and from a business standpoint it would look very good on a resume.  I see no legal issues with this open source bot and the technical challenges of the pitch seem very doable.
